# decision-house
Part of the decision making project, related to making decision about what house to buy

# goal
The goal is to help the user understand what are the priority for buying a house. We are looking to use a simple comparison between two properties to do this. For example, for a similar amount of money, would the user prefer to have large size or a pool. More bedroom or a reading room. More modern rennovation or large size. Good school or large area. Large backyard or good hill top view.
